Note: 
- use QUANTUM=10ms for all test cases

small_testcases.c
=================
Perform small virtual heap allocations, and allow to incrementally test: 
- vcreate 
- vmalloc
- vfree
- page fault handler: lazy allocation and segmentation fault
- allocations requiring multiple pages of PT
- concurrent processes

Output:
- small_testcases.out

large_testcases.c
=================
Perform large virtual heap allocations 

Output:
The test case outcome is embedded in the run. 
If you need more information to debug your code, uncomment the "#define DEBUG" line. The 'large_testcases.out' output file contains debugging information. 

Note that, in multi-process runs, the processes' interleaving might change from run to run (possibly affecting the debugging output).

swapping_testcases.c 
====================
Perform large virtual heap allocations causing swapping.
Note: have a look at the information in the comment at the beginning of the test case file.  
 
Outputs: 
- swapping_testcases.out - prints up to 50 evictions/swappings per test case 
- swapping_testcases_full.out - prints all the evictions/swappings (large file, running the full test case is time consuming)
