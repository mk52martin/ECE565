SETTINGS: The mlfqX.out files are generated by running test case file mlfq.c using different settings for QUANTUM, TIME_ALLOTMENT and PRIORITY_BOOST_PERIOD. The values used are indicated in the first line of each output file.

NOTE: The kill() function incurs preemption (due to the send/receive sequence). Therefore, you should measure the turnaround time when exiting (and not at the beginning) of the kill() function.

EXPECTED DEVIATIONS FROM TEST CASE RESULTS:

You can expect the times and number of context switch operations to vary slightly from run to run. Some trends, however, should be consistent. For example:
- For test case 1, the two processes should have a similar turnaround time. Since they execute in an interleaved fashion and have the same runtime, their turnaround time should be approximately twice their runtime.
- For test case 3, the processes should  hide each other's sleep latencies.

Have a look at the code of the test cases to identify other trends that your outputs should not violate.
